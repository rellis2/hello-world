Salutations!

My name is Ryan and I am, at the time of writing this, a novice in most things related to computer science/information systems and especially coding. 
I am a biology major working on the bachelor's degree but software development and computers in general have been of great interest to me, I just never got around to really digging into it. 
I hope to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to create some really awesome things!
